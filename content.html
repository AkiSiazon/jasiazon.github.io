			<p>Our country has one of the things that makes us one of the top known countries in the world. Although the COVID-19 virus seems like the perfect response, it is not. Instead, it is an issue that our country has already loved and embraced, which is corruption. A lot of events have occurred in our nation, and corruption is only one of the major problems that we are facing today. An example of corruption can be the Priority Development Assistance Fund scam, which is commonly called the Pork Barrel scam, wherein government officials take the Priority Development Assistance Fund(PDAF) for their selfish personal interests, even if the PDAF was supposed to be primarily used for priority development projects. And because of dirty acts like these, many funds that are supposedly given to the people have been wasted on selfish and “clean” officials, which perfectly fits them for the word pig, and later made into pork. It even looks as if this problem has already been put into the big bucket of the government’s “Unsolved Problems", and has no hope of ever getting out. But fortunately, there may be a way to solve this problem.</p>

			<p>For every problem, there is a solution. If given the chance, I would like to suggest a proposal wherein corruption would cease to exist in a second. Simply put, the proposal that I would like to present concerns the topic of death penalties. Morbid it may be, but it could be the best solution there is.The solution brought by death penalties have many beneficial effects. First of all, they provide an example to the many violators of the law. If a person who violates the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act were to be executed, other corrupt officials would be given the clear image of their punishment, and therefore help them to change their minds in doing these actions. If they are given punishments like fines, prision mayor or prision correccional, there can still be a high chance that some of them would still refuse to change and return to their old ways. But with death penalties, these corrupt officials would be put to stop immediately, and not only would corruption decrease, but also the people who would commit this act. In addition, death penalties would also save us from future problems like overpopulation. From the many corrupt bodies of the government, it is sure to decrease the population on our planet, which could also reduce our chance in encountering overpopulation. And with death penalties, we can also save up finance for our country, since most of it has already been hogged by these corrupt officials. And with all the funds that they have stolen, maybe setting up an official execution house would be appropriate for them.</p>
			
			<p>But if this solution does not appeal to anyone's minds, some other solutions can be implemented to reduce the effects of corruption. One can be punishing corrupt voters or vote buyers with heavy fines. Because of the votes given by manipulated voters who blindly vote for politicians they see, corrupt officials are able to enter the congress and destroy our country’s prosperity. So if we punish these people who sold or received money for blind votes, we can stop the entering of corrupt officials and governors in our government, and at least decrease the effects of corruption. In addition, any vote holders who also violate the rules in vote ballots should be heavily fined, since this can also help corruption spread in our government.</p>

			<p>If we were not to implement these kinds of solutions, our country would continue to suffer from the hands of corrupt officials, and maybe even become bankrupt. It also cannot be avoided that as of 2011, the Philippines has already lost P19.34 trillion of funds due to illegal financial flow, which also led to the loss of P19.34 trillion that could have been given to our community to be able to live a better life. And with that amount of money disappearing from corrupt acts in 2011, more money may be even lost as of today, which can later turn the Philippines into a living hell. So if in order to prevent more catastrophic events that can cause the Philippines to crumble, we must act quickly and find punishments for violators in order to decrease the spread of corruption.              <br><br><br>
